    Remember: **LinkedIn is mandatory**. Put your best work here.
    - **Twitter profile:** If you have a really good portfolio, LinkedIn and blogs then you can skip this one. Otherwise, put a proper profile together. 
    Put a decent bio, choose a nice username, and put a profile pic too. 
    Again, see the Retweets from neoG Camp to see how others are doing it. If you don't get original ideas, see and get inspired!
